,,"plugin or System Date and Time Editor). Otherwise, the time zone is displayed for information only."
Record Type,Text,"Read only values. Displays the data that the record holds in terms of: extension type ( history ) and data type ( Boolean- TrendRecord NumericTrendRecord , , and so on)."
Capacity,"Record Count: nnn (500 default), Unlimited","Specifies local storage capacity for histories. In general, 500 (default record count) or less is adequate for a controller sta- tion because those records are usually archived (exported) to a Supervisor station. For this reason, a very large number, such as 250,000 is acceptable for Supervisor stations. Unlimited is not the wisest choice even for a Supervisor station."
Full Policy,"Roll (default), Stop","Applies only if Capacity is set to 'Record Count'. Upon speci- fied record count, the oldest records are overwritten by new- est records. Roll ensures that the latest data are recorded. Stop terminates recording when the number of stored records reaches specified history capacity. Full policy has no effect if Capacity is Unlimited ."
Interval,Text string,"Read only value. For Interval-based data collection, the cycle time, or how often the history properties are checked. Any time you change this property, a new history is created (or 'split-off') from the original history because histories with dif- ferent intervals are not compatible."
System Tags,Text,This property allows you to assign additional metadata (the System Tag) to a history extension. This identifier is then avail- able for selective import or export of histories using the Niag- ara System History Import or Niagara System History Export option (using the System Tag Patterns). Each System Tag is separated by a semicolon. For example: NorthAmeri- ca;Region1;Cities .
Last Record,,"Container for read only values for sub-properties that describe attributes of the last recorded change: date/time the last re- cord was made, time zone, and the operation that generated the record, and the user who made the change."
